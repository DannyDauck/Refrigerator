# Refrigerator
 Simple Refrigerator Asset


This is a simple Unity-Asset created in Blender. You are free to download and use it. For the scene a
simple script is added that moves the cam with the the arrow keys, so you can walk a little around.
I added a free night skybox to show of the lighning effects.
